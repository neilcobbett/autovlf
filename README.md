# autovlf
Autonomous VLF is code developed around the Beagle Bone Black SBC.  It primarily uses a TLV320 soundcard to record VLF Data up to 96KHz sample speed.
It uses a GPS Pulse Per Second (PPS) signal to keep the system phase stable by feeding this signal into the sound card with the VLF signal on the other channel.

This is my first github test
